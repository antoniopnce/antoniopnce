- Hi, I’m Antonio
- I’m interested in Computer Engineering
- I’m currently learning C, C++ and Linux
- I'm originally from Hawaii
- I'm a JUNIOR in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I love to build computers and reasearching and developing
- A fun fact about me is:  I love playing videogames and going to the beach
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I hope to learn coding that is more in line with my major and developing real experience
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Spirited Away
